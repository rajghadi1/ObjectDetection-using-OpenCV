# ObjectDetection-using-OpenCV

we required following files:-
1) YOLO3-SPP.weights
2) YOLO3.config
3) coco.names
4) image data
5) video data

Download Weights and config file from following URL-(https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

all other files are already added in my GitHub repository but weights file is not added in the repository because its file size(250MB+) is more than github file upload limit(i.e, 25MB) so you need to download it from above provided link
